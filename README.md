# Turnabout Nincompoop

Turnabout Nincompoop is an attorney simulator in which you, hereinafter referred to as "the user", will use their carefully prepared notes to make coherent arguments and advocate for their clients' innocence. 

During court, if the user has boosted their avatar's confidence to the maximum by verbally abusing the prosecution, the user can OBJECT to any single wrong they deem an injustice. This will enable the user to act more smug and stop the flow of time.

After complex legal analysis a verdict will be passed. The user's client will then be sentenced guilty or not guilty based on including, but not limited to how many times Orla the Orca isn't mentioned. 

Having got a guilty or non guilty verdict, the user is highly encouraged to virtually sign a document consisting of multiple sections of Lorem Ipsum. By submitting their document, the user will become a certified Nice Attorney™ and get an access to an exclusive database front-end view listing previous users' amazing accomplishments.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
